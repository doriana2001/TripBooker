# TripBooker


## Goal

The aim is to create a user-friendly platform where users can effortlessly search for travel destinations, filter hotels according to their preferences (like the number of days and guests), and view detailed information and images of accommodations. Authenticated users can also book rooms directly. By providing easy-to-use filters based on country, dates, guests, and budget, the platform aims to make finding the perfect accommodation simpler and more personalized for clients.

## Technologies

The technologies used in my thesis project were self-taught and not covered in university courses. The main technologies I studied to develop the web application for the tourism domain are React.js, Node.js, and MongoDB. React.js is an open-source JavaScript library used for building interactive and reusable user interfaces. It provides an efficient and declarative model for creating UI components that can dynamically update based on changes in the application's state.
